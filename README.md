# FinalProject

# Description
This is the program that helps my candy store to thrive. This java program helps the candy store keep track of inventory by adding, selling, and viewing products. 

# Instructions to Run Program
1. Compile program before running
2. Run the program using the java Runner
3. Chose task options from available menu

# How It Works
1. Option 1: Allows the user to add candy into the available inventory
2. Option 2: Allows the user to sell candy and it be removed from the available inventory
3. Option 3: Allows the user to be able to view the sold out invetory list as well as the available inventory list. 
4. Option 4: Allows the user to exit the application and the data to be saved. 

# Limitations
- Only able to sell, add, and view candies.

# Future Improvements
- Duplicates in sold-out list and available list.
- Being able to see quantity of candies.
- Add a alert to be displayed once a candy's inventory is low.
